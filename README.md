	Drove to a river yesterday with a friend. 
	Transcribed what he said on bright pink paper. 
	Devised a new organization plan. 

#All my projects and ideas will be open and posted. Open to collaboration. No budget, but fair fees can be requested and funding solicited.#

*(Probably as a project unto itself, for which help will also be welcomed.)*
